//TODO all

/*
 *  takes reference maps from ai and generates terrain that follows it with generated rivers,
 *  lakes, and earth with noise and ideally things like erosion in the long-term
 *
 *  if possible, it would be nice to have the terrain be generated in a way that roughly follows
 *  contours on the reference map, but that is not a priority
 *
 *  the terrain should be generated in a way that is easy to modify by the user, so that they can
 *  customize their campaign world in the in the medium/long-term
